You will find 3 files in this directory:

- README.txt
- test.rb
- sample.json

Update the test.rb program (that reads the json object in "sample.json") and output the answer to these questions:

1. Print the names of all cat lovers. [X]
2. Print the average number of pets for all people who are both cat lovers and dog lovers. [X]
3. How many cat only lovers are there? [X]
4. Print all the pet names separated by a comma, sorted alphabetically, and remove any/all duplicates (Andy, Lulu, Rover, et. al) [X]
5. Print the names of everyone who has a pet with the same name (for example, if ‘Ken’ and ‘Kris; both have a pet named ‘Evie’, the output should read: “Ken and Kris have a pet named Evie”). Output a line for every pair of humans that share a pet with a same name. There will never be more than 2 pets that share a name, and there will never be more than 2 humans who share a pet with the same name.[X]

The program should run in the terminal:

ruby test.rb

I will test by switching out the sample.json file with another file that matches the structure of the sample.json file.
